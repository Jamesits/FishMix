Osu Fish Skin

This Osu Skin is made with pieces from Cookiezi's old skin (SameSkinButNoHitCirclesWierdName) as well as the charui_skin_1_2, Brighter-Lights, and various elements from http://osuskinner.com/

I plan on redoing most of this skin in a Ship of Theseus style (little by litle one piece at a time until the whole thing is different).

Updates:
Fish 1.2.2

  Changed sliderpoints and object numbers to match score and combo numbers
